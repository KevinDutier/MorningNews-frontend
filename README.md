# MorningNews - Frontend

MorningNews is a project that was made using React during my Web Developper coding bootcamp at La Capsule, Paris.

It is a website that displays the latest tech news articles dynamically by communicating with the News API.

It allows the user to bookmark, hide and unhide articles.

API: [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
